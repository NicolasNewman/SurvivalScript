> An engaging game to teach beginners how to read documentation

## Intro

> ![](img/Demo.png)

Script Survival was created at Purdue's Hello World 2019 24 hour Hackathon. The goal of the project is to teach
beginners of programming how to read documentation, since we belive many learning resources don't actually teach you how to keep learning once you finish the resource.
