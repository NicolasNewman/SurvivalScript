    } \n
	Def. A For loop completes an action for as long as a statement is true; the example above will print All Hail Central Command 5 times, when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not when i=5\n
	Note: Varibles can be updated citing themselves in addition to a modifier, this statement(i++) will increases i by one each time the loop is run\n

    Def. A While loop contains a repetitive action that is continued until the criteria is no longer met\n
