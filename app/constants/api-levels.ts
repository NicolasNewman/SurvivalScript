    \n# Basics 1 
    \n**WARNING:** All standardized bots are required to communicate through the following methods, use of any code outside of convention will lead to deactivation 
    \n## Operators 
    \nOperators are symbols that can interact with variables 
    \n= 
    \nx=5 
    \n**Def:** = used to assign a variable a value, the value of x is now 5 
    \n== 
    \nx == 5 
    \n**Def:** == used to compare the value of two variables returning true or false, x does equal 5 and therefore this is true 
    
    \nValues using these operators are controlled, maintained and updated by the Central Command, tampering with such values will lead to deactivation 
    
    \n+ 
    \nx = 5+5 
    \n**Def:** + used to add two numbers 
    
    \n- 
    \nx = 10-5 
    \n**Def:** - used to subtract two numbers 
    
    \n* 
    \nx = 5*5 
    \n**Def:** * used to multiply two numbers together 
    
    \n/ 
    \nx = 10/5 
    \n**Def:** / used to divide two numbers 
    
    \n##Variables: 
    \nVariables are names assigned to different types of data 
    \nrobotName = ‚ÄúQwerty‚Äù 
    \n**Def:** variable above is type **string** with the identity of the text inside quoutes 
    \nüîè robotHealth = 1 
    \nüîè robotBatteryLife = 100 
    \n**Def:** variables above are type **integer** which take on a whole number value
    \n**WARNING:** Bot: Qwerty is currently at critical health 
    \nsatVideoX = 5.395673954 
    \nsatVideoY = 12.486509372 
    \nrobotX = 5.000000000 
    \nrobotY = 12.000000000 
    \n**Def:** variables above are type **double** which take on numbers with decimal places 
    
    \narray = [entry1,entry2, ‚Ä¶] 
    \nsatVideoCordinates = [satVideoX, satVideoY] 
    \nrobotCordinates = [robotX, robotY] 
    \n**Def:** An **array**, an organizational tool for saving multiple, often related, data points 
    \nTo alter a list either redefine the variables in the list then redefine the list again or input listName.varibleWithinListName[newValue] to change the value of an individual point within a list 
    \n##Functions
    \nFunctions are how bots communicate with Central Command to perform tasks
    \nprint(‚Äúprinted material‚Äù)
	\n**Def:** function print() prints the information within the paranthesis
