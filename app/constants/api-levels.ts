    \nPrint(“True”)
    \n}
    \nElse{
    \nPrint(”False”)
    \n}
	\nDef. An If statement is a conditional and will run or not run a certain code contained within itself depending on the validity of the condition
    \n
    \nFor():
    \nFor(i = 0; i<5; i++){
    \nPrint(“All Hail Central Command”)
    \n} 
	\nDef. A For loop completes an action for as long as a statement is true; the example above will print All Hail Central Command 5 times, when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not when i=5
	\nNote: Varibles can be updated citing themselves in addition to a modifier, this statement(i++) will increases i by one each time the loop is run

    \nWhile():
    \nIf (fileName == corrupted){
    \nWhile(fileName=corrupted) {
    \nclean(fileName)
    \n}
    \n}
    \nDef. A While loop contains a repetitive action that is continued until the criteria is no longer met
    \nWARNING: The Central Command does not recommend cleaning files by the above method, results may vary
