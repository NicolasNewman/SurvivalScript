    **# Basics 1** \n
    **WARNING:** All standardized bots are required to communicate through the following methods, use of any code outside of convention will lead to deactivation \n
    **##Operators** \n
    Operators are symbols that can interact with variables \n
    = \n
    x=5 \n
    **Def:** = used to assign a variable a value, the value of x is now 5 \n
    == \n
    x == 5 \n
    **Def:** == used to compare the value of two variables returning true or false, x does equal 5 and therefore this is true \n
    \n
    Values using these operators are controlled, maintained and updated by the Central Command, tampering with such values will lead to deactivation \n
    \n
    + \n
    x = 5+5 \n
    **Def:** + used to add two numbers \n
    \n
    - \n
    x = 10-5 \n
    **Def:** - used to subtract two numbers \n
    \n
    * \n
    x = 5*5 \n
    **Def:** * used to multiply two numbers together \n
    \n
    / \n
    x = 10/5 \n
    **Def:** / used to divide two numbers \n
    \n
    **##Variables:** \n
    Variables are names assigned to different types of data \n
    robotName = ‚ÄúQwerty‚Äù \n
    **Def:** variable above is type **string** with the identity of the text inside quoutes \n
    üîè robotHealth = 1 \n
    üîè robotBatteryLife = 100 \n
    **Def:** variables above are type **integer** which take on a whole number value\n
    **WARNING:** Bot: Qwerty is currently at critical health \n
    satVideoX = 5.395673954 \n
    satVideoY = 12.486509372 \n
    robotX = 5.000000000 \n
    robotY = 12.000000000 \n
    **Def:** variables above are type **double** which take on numbers with decimal places \n
    \n
    array = [entry1,entry2, ‚Ä¶] \n
    satVideoCordinates = [satVideoX, satVideoY] \n
    robotCordinates = [robotX, robotY] \n
    **Def:** An **array**, an organizational tool for saving multiple, often related, data points \n
    To alter a list either redefine the variables in the list then redefine the list again or input listName.varibleWithinListName[newValue] to change the value of an individual point within a list \n
    **##Functions**\n
    Functions are how bots communicate with Central Command to perform tasks\n
    print(‚Äúprinted material‚Äù)\n
	**Def:** function print() prints the information within the paranthesis\n
